The dataset includes 116 images.
People-boxes-to-segmentations are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -13 and +13 degrees
* Random exposure adjustment of between -22 and +22 percent
